# Game Host (work in progress title)
is a game hosting site for web games similar to miniclip.com or others.
- Users can use the site as a guest i.e no signup and can play all the games that are hosted
- If the user signs up they have the ability to comment on games
- Users can also sign up as a game developer and publish their own web based games 

## TODO
- Fix game player layout
- Show game upload progress to user
- Show all games on home screen
- Check "remeber me" is working as intended
- Tweak site for mobile
- Stream file uploads to cloud drive so server storage isnt needed
- Check old uploaded content is deleted after being replaced
